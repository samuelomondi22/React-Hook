ReactDOM 
-provides DOM specific methods that can be used on app

ReactDOM -- render JSX(convinient tool to write readable HTML within javascript
) directly to to HTML DOM

ReactDOM.render(element, container, [callback]) - 
render is to get or fetch data

ReactDOM.hydrate(element, container, [callback])

ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(element, container, [callback])

ReactDOM.findDOMNode(element, container, [callback])

ReactDOM.createPortal(element, container, [callback])
To display a react component in a browser we need to instruct the reactDOM library on how to do that (ReactDOM.render())

useState()
-is the way if we need an internal state and don't need to implement more complex logic such as lifecycle methods.
